SYNOPSIS

   use YN00;
   @arg = ($filename,$,$,$);
   $ref_ary = YN00::cal_kaks(\@arg);
   @kaks_values = @{$ref_ary};

DESCRIPTION

   This is a module that uses SWIG to make PAML/yn00.c usable in Perl. It
   does not parse output file(s) originally generated by PAML/yn00.c. Actually
   there is no output file at all. The argument users need to provide is the
   same: 
      sequence file: containing aligned DNA sequences;
      icode: genetic codes (0..10)
         0 - universal code, 
	 1 - mammalian mt,
	 2 - yeast mt.,
	 3 - mold mt.,
	 4 - invertebrate mt.,
	 5 - ciliate nuclear,
	 6 - echinoderm mt.,
	 7 - euplotid mt.,
	 8 - alternative yeast nu.,
	 9 - ascidian mt.,
	 10 - blepharisma nu.
      weighting: weighting pathways between codons (0/1)
      commonf3x4: use one set of codon freqs for all pairs (0/1)
      
   For two sequences, the module will calculate the Ka and ks values based
   on Yang et all 2000 paper algorithm. It returns 6 values accordingly:
   S : number of synonymous site.
   N : number of non-synonymous site.
   dN : the number of non-synonymous changes per non-synonymous site. 
   SE : standard deviation of dN
   dS : the number of synonymous changes per synonymous site.
   SE : standard deviation of dS
   
   If there are more than two sequences, the values will be appended at the
   end of array accordingly.
   
   This is created from paml3.13 version.

CAVEATS / LIMITATIONS

   1. Input sequence file must fit the requirement of PAML/yn00.c
      Ex. Sequence length must be multiple of three
          No stop codon is allowed.
   2. If something wrong is happened, the module will exit the program.
